    <h1>The Rise of CO₂ and Global Temperature</h1>
    <p>A Data-Driven Study of Industrial Acceleration</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>
        How did CO₂ emissions change during and after industrialization,
        and how strongly are these changes associated with global temperature rise?
    </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Understanding Global Warming</h2>
    <p>
        Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth’s average surface temperature.
        Scientists measure temperature anomaly, which represents deviation from a historical baseline.
    </p>

    <h2>The Industrial Era</h2>
    <p>
        Beginning around 1750, industrialization introduced large-scale fossil fuel combustion,
        leading to a dramatic increase in atmospheric carbon emissions.

    <h2>Rise of CO₂ Emissions</h2>

    <p>
        Emissions remained low prior to industrialization but accelerated sharply
        after 1950, marking the period of rapid industrial growth.

    <h2>Temperature Acceleration</h2>
    <img src="./temperature_rise_plot.png">
    <p>
        Global temperature anomalies show a clear upward acceleration,
        increasing over four times faster after 1950 compared to earlier periods.
    </p>

    <h2>Statistical Relationship</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Correlation: 0.815</li>
        <li>R²: 0.6646</li>
        <li>Post-1950 warming rate: 4x higher</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The analysis demonstrates a strong statistical relationship between
        industrial CO₂ emissions and accelerated global temperature rise.
