    <p class="para ml-40">This project analyzes historical CO₂ emissions per capita and global temperature anomaly records to understand the relationship between industrialization, CO₂ emissions, and global temperature rise. The analysis includes data visualization, correlation analysis, and trend analysis to explore how CO₂ emissions have evolved over time and their impact on global temperatures.</p>

 <h2 class="heading2 ml-30">What is Global Warming and Temperature Change?</h2>
 <p class="para ml-40">Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth’s average surface temperature. In this project, temperature change is represented by global temperature anomaly, which measures each year’s deviation from a historical baseline.</p>
 <br/>
 <h2 class="heading2 ml-30">Industrialization Period</h2>
 <p class="para ml-40">Industrialization began in the mid-18th century and expanded significantly after 1900, with substantial acceleration after 1950. The increased use of fossil fuels during this period is reflected in the sharp rise in carbon emissions.</p>

        <p class="co2-text">Rise of CO₂ Emissions Over Time

The CO₂ emissions per capita plot reveals a clear shift in global carbon output beginning with industrialization. Prior to 1800, emissions remained extremely low and relatively stable, reflecting limited industrial activity and reliance on traditional energy sources such as biomass. During this pre-industrial period, human impact on atmospheric carbon levels was minimal.
<br/>
<br/>
With the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, a gradual upward trend becomes visible. The adoption of coal-powered machinery, steam engines, and mechanized manufacturing increased fossil fuel consumption. Emissions continued to rise steadily as industrial growth expanded across Europe, North America, and later other regions of the world.
<br/>
<br/>
The most significant acceleration occurs after 1950. This period marks rapid economic expansion, increased automobile use, large-scale electricity production, and widespread reliance on oil and natural gas. The slope of the emissions curve becomes noticeably steeper, indicating a substantial rise in per capita carbon output. Although minor dips appear during economic downturns or global crises, the overall long-term trend remains strongly upward.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the plot demonstrates a structural transformation in global energy consumption patterns, highlighting how industrial and post-industrial development significantly increased carbon emissions worldwide.</p>

        <p class="co2-text">Global Temperature Anomaly Over Time

The temperature anomaly plot shows how Earth’s average surface temperature deviates from a historical baseline. Early records show relatively small fluctuations, but a clear upward trend appears in the 20th century.
<br/>
<br/>
After 1950, the curve rises more sharply, reflecting accelerated warming that aligns with increased greenhouse gas emissions and industrial activity. Short-term variability remains, but the long-term direction is consistently upward.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the plot highlights sustained warming over the modern era, reinforcing the connection between human activity and global temperature change.</p>

        <p class="co2-text">Combined Trend of CO₂ and Temperature

The merged plot places CO₂ emissions per capita and temperature anomaly trends side by side. Both lines remain relatively flat before industrialization, then rise steadily in the modern era.
<br/>
<br/>
The alignment of upward movement suggests a strong association: as emissions increase, global temperatures also trend higher. This combined view makes the relationship between carbon output and warming more visually clear.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the merged plot reinforces how post‑industrial growth in emissions corresponds with long-term temperature rise.</p>
